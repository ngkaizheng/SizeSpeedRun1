# SizeSpeedRun!

Welcome to SizeSpeedRun, a simple runner game built using the Runner Template in the Unity Editor. This game is designed purely for educational purposes, aimed at helping beginners understand the flow of game development and grasp concepts like level design.

## Features:

- **Two Levels**: SizeSpeedRun offers two levels for players to navigate through. Each level presents its own challenges and obstacles, providing an opportunity for players to enhance their skills.
  
- **Exit Button**: We've included an exit button within the game interface, allowing users to quit the game easily whenever they desire.

## How to Play:

1. **Objective**: The goal of SizeSpeedRun is to navigate through each level while avoiding obstacles and collecting coins and keys.
   
2. **Controls**: The character movement is cursor-based, meaning it will follow the position of your cursor on the screen. Direct the cursor to where you want the character to move - left or right- and the character will follow accordingly, navigating through the obstacles and pathways presented in each level.

3. **Collect Rewards**: Throughout the game, keep an eye out for coins and keys that can help you progress further or achieve a higher score.

4. **Complete Levels**: Successfully navigate through each level to progress to the next one. Be prepared for increasing difficulty as you advance!

5. **Exit Game**: When you're ready to exit the game, simply locate and click on the exit button within the game interface.
